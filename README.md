# NACH0 Colours
This mod adds expansions to the coloured blocks that the base game has, this includes 17 different colours.
The base game textures i.e. carpet have been renamed in the locale to better represent the new array of colours, the type names however have remained the same so your builds using base game blocks will remain the same.
The coloured blocks now require either dye or paint both of which can be found in the Paint Mixer which is a new job, and the coloured blocks can either be found in the base game dyertable or the new painters table.

Colours that are inculded in the array:
  -Aqua
  -Black
  -Brown
  -Dark Blue
  -Dark Green
  -Dark Red
  -Gold
  -Green
  -Grey
  -Light Blue
  -Light Brown
  -Light Grey
  -Light Pink
  -Magenta
  -Orange
